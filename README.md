Public Kaggle Code and Info
======

I will try to post code when I wind up close enough to the top that my models might be slightly interesting.

Unfortunately, most of my development is spent in fragments, and often split between SQL and R, so I'll do the best I can of getting functions posted and some sense of driver code enough to get the point across.
